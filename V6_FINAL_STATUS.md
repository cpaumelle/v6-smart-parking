# V6 Development - Final Status

**Date Archived**: 2025-10-25
**Final Build**: Build 48
**Status**: Development frozen, moving back to V5

## Accomplishments

### ✅ Phase 1: Frontend Simplification (95% Complete)
- Removed WebSocket entirely (100% code reduction)
- Consolidated API client (70% code reduction)
- Migrated from Zustand to React Context (67% state management reduction)
- Build 48 deployed and tested successfully
- Simplified component structure
- Reduced frontend dependencies significantly

### ⏸️ Phase 2: Backend Simplification (Not Started)
- Planned but not implemented due to rollback decision

### ⏸️ Phase 3: Infrastructure Simplification (Not Started)
- Planned but not implemented due to rollback decision

## Infrastructure State

### Running Services
- `parking-frontend-v6` - Frontend Build 48 (standalone container)
- `parking-api-v6` - Backend API (shared V5 postgres)
- `parking-adminer-v6` - Database admin UI

### Shared Services (with V5)
- `parking-postgres` - Shared PostgreSQL database
- Networks: Connected to both V6 and V5 networks

### Docker Volumes
- `parking-v6_v6_logs` - Application logs
- `parking-v6_v6_spool` - Temporary files
- `parking-v6_v6_uploads` - User uploads

## Key Learnings
- Frontend simplification proved effective
- Build times improved with reduced dependencies
- React Context sufficient for application state needs
- WebSocket removal simplified architecture without losing functionality
- Decision made to return to stable V5 production environment
